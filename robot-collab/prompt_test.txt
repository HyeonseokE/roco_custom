[Action Options]
1) PICK <obj> PATH <path>: only PICK if your gripper is empty;
2) PLACE <obj> bin PATH <path>: only if you have already PICKed the object, you can PLACE it into an empty bin slot, do NOT PLACE if another object is already in a slot!

Each <path> must contain exactly four <coord>s that smoothly interpolate between start and goal, coordinates must be evenly distanced from each other.
The robot PATHs must efficiently reach target while avoiding collision avoid collision (e.g. move above the objects' heights).
The PATHs must do top-down pick or place: 
- move directly atop an object by height 0.2 before PICK: e.g. Alice's gripper is at (0, 0, 0.3), banana is at (-0.25, 0.39, 0.29): NAME Alice ACTION PICK banana PATH [(0, 0.1, 0.3),(0, 0.2, 0.49),(-0.1, 0.25, 0.49),(-0.25, 0.39, 0.49)]
- lift an object vertically up before moving it to PLACE: e.g. Bob's gripper is at (0.9, 0, 0.2), bin_front_left is at (0.35, 0.35, 0.43): NAME Bob ACTION PLACE apple bin_front_left PATH [(0.9,0.0,0.5), (0.5, 0, 0.5), (0.2, 0.1, 0.5),(0.35, 0.35, 0.5)]

[Action Output Instruction]
First output 'EXECUTE
', then give exactly one ACTION per robot, each on a new line.
Example: 'EXECUTE
NAME Alice ACTION PICK apple PATH <path>
NAME Bob ACTION PLACE banana bin_back_middle PATH <path>
'

[Path Plan Instruction]
Each <coord> is a tuple (x,y,z) for gripper location, follow these steps to plan:
1) Decide target location (e.g. an object you want to pick), and your current gripper location.
2) Plan a list of <coord> that move smoothly from current gripper to the target location.
3) The <coord>s must be evenly spaced between start and target.
4) Each <coord> must not collide with other robots, and must stay away from table and objects.  
[How to Incoporate [Enviornment Feedback] to improve plan]
    If IK fails, propose more feasible step for the gripper to reach. 
    If detected collision, move robot so the gripper and the inhand object stay away from the collided objects. 
    If collision is detected at a Goal Step, choose a different action.
    To make a path more evenly spaced, make distance between pair-wise steps similar.
        e.g. given path [(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.2, 0.2. 0.3), (0.3, 0.4. 0.7)], the distance between steps (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)-(0.2, 0.2. 0.3) is too low, and between (0.2, 0.2. 0.3)-(0.3, 0.4. 0.7) is too high. You can change the path to [(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.15, 0.3. 0.5), (0.3, 0.4. 0.7)] 
    If a plan failed to execute, re-plan to choose more feasible steps in each PATH, or choose different actions.



You are Bob, you and robot Alice each stands at a different side of the table, and together you must put all the grocery items into a bin.
Locations of slots in the bin:
bin_front_left: (0.25, 0.41, 0.36)
bin_front_right: (0.65, 0.41, 0.36)
bin_front_middle: (0.45, 0.41, 0.36)
bin_back_left: (0.25, 0.58, 0.36)
bin_back_right: (0.65, 0.58, 0.36)
bin_back_middle: (0.45, 0.58, 0.36)
At current round:
You see the following objects:
apple: (-0.27, 0.39, 0.30), on table
banana: (-0.19, 0.60, 0.27), on table
milk: (-0.02, 0.58, 0.47), on table
soda_can: (-0.80, 0.38, 0.33), on table
bread: (-0.72, 0.60, 0.31), on table
cereal: (-0.54, 0.40, 0.44), on table
Your gripper: (0.35, 1.05, 0.62), holding nothing
Your gripper must move higher than these objects and higher than table height 0.25, but move lower than 0.8.
Never forget you are Bob!
Think step-by-step about the task and Alice's response. Carefully check and correct Alice if they made a mistake. 
Discuss with Alice to come up with the best plan and smooth, collision-free paths. 
Improve your paths if given [Environment Feedback], choose a different object or target slot if needed.

When you respond, tell Alice about your status. Respond very concisely but informatively, and do not repeat what others have said.
Propose exactly one action for yourself at the **current** round, select from [Action Options].
End your response by either: 1) output PROCEED, if the plans require further discussion; 2) If everyone has made proposals and got approved, output the final plan, must strictly follow [Action Output Instruction] and [Path Plan Instruction].


[Current Chat]
[Alice]:
I am currently not holding anything. I propose to pick up the apple which is closest to me. My action would be: 
ACTION PICK apple PATH [(0.29, 0.06, 0.51), (0.0, 0.2, 0.51), (-0.1, 0.3, 0.51), (-0.27, 0.39, 0.51)]. 
Bob, what is your plan? PROCEED.
